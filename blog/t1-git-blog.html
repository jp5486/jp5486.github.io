    <p> What are the benefits of version control? </p>
      <p> Imagine a selfcontained enviornment where you are able to rewind a day,week, month or year. That is the heart of version control. It gives you a baseline that you can backtrack to; a save point where you felt comfortable and can start from there again. With version control you will not need to worry about overwriting work and losing it forever, the previous versions will always be there to fall back on.</p>
    <p>How does git help you keep track of changes?</p>
      <p>Git keeps a record of every commit or save that you make and enables you to access each one of those save points at any time. </p>
    <p>Why use GitHub to store your code?</p>
      <p>Github is a very well established social media which allows you to interact with like minded users. Share and collaborate your code and projects and grow in teams rather than struggle on your own. </p>
