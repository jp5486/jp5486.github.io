      <p>Today we will discuess the differences between arrays and hashes and provide some examples of how to use each</p>
      <p>By definition an array is an ordered, integer-indexed collection of objects; and a hash is a dictionary-like collection of uniqure keys and their values. <br>Now what does that mean?</p>
      <p>In its simpliest sense, an array is a store set of objects. These objects can be strings, integers, floats or even other arrays. A hash is a more defined version of an array in that is has a key and value pair, similar to a dictionary. In a dictionary you have a word and a description of that word. The key is like a word and the value being the description. You access the value(or definition) of a key(or word). </p>
      <h4>Lets look at some examples of each.</h4>
      <img src="../imgs/array_example.png">
      <p>Here is an example of an array called "my_family". I have stored 5 strings inside. At the 0 placeholder(the very first place in the list since we start counting from 0) I have stored the string "my name". "father" is in the 1 placeholder </p>
      <p> Now on line 3 we call the entire value of the my_family array and line 5 the value of the 0 placeholder. Replace the number to choose which spot you want. Below we see the output.</p>
      <img src="../imgs/array_example_answer.png">
      <p>The entire array is called in response to line 3 and just the very first string value is called in response to line 5.</p>

      <h4>Now lets look over some Hash Examples</h4>
      <img src="../imgs/hash_example.png">
      <p>Here we have a hash called my_family_hash with various assignments for each name. The definition for my_name is Jeremy, father is Ernie, mother is Carol, etc. Again, we call the entire hash variable on line 11 and the definition for the first assignment on line 13.</p>
      <img src="../imgs/hash_example_answer.png">
      <p>Here are the responses from our terminal. We see the entire hash printed out and the first definition on the next line, Perfect!</p>
      <p>Even though this is not a comprehensive article, we can start see the subtle differences between an array and hash. You can see the key:value or word:definition relationship in an array as well, the only difference is you cannot chose the keys. They are fixed as integers counting upwards from 0. In a hash you are able to write the key and value for each one.</p>
      <p>Please refer to the Ruby documentation online for a more in depth breakdown of all the features that arrays and hashes are capable of.</p>
