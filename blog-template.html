How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  I personally enjoyed it. I have no previous experience with blog posts besides casual internet browsing and having another person (who happened to be well versed) gave me the opportunity to ask questions and talk through them. I now feel very comfortable with wireframing. I personally feel a bit rusty on my HTML skills as it has been months since I covered the materials on Code Academy. Having a pair to review what I was doing and give suggestions helped me save at least an hour of personal research (due to my lack of experience with blogs and HTML5).

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  When I was trying to learn it on my own - no. As I researched good blogs to grasp ideas, I kept getting distracted and found myself looking into design aspects instead of properly understanding wireframing. After pairing I have a much better grasp and feel comfortable in using as a development step.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We decided that a good wireframe properly divided and structured the web page. Simple sketches or very detailed wireframes were discussed as equally useable as long as it fit into your own development process.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ? -->
