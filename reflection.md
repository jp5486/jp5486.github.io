What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  Playing with simple shapes is a lot easier than working with actual divs. Working with the 3 elements around the content is as difficult as I imagined it- especially since the way I initially learned was through using bootstrap.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

  I have no control over it yet. I was attempting to center my social media icons and failed. I tried to center my h1 under my nav bar floating to the right and image placeholder floating to the left and was barely able to make things properly visible.

  I have pictures picked out for a banner in the backtop of my page but have decided on saving that for later after I am able to fix the other elements on my page properly.


What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

  I thought I had a firm grasp on floats but I am no longer confident. I was not able to get my page to where I would like it to be and still have tons of work to do.

  I think some of the functionality such as forward and backwards buttons and linking live blogs on the index page will happen when we integrate javascript.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

  Again, I have plenty to learn still. I have always had a hard time with front end development and this has kind of scarred me further. I can come up with the imagine in my head but am unable to format it properly on a webpage. It's very frustrating.
